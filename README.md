## Material Colors

Colors from Google's Material Design put into easy to use classes for color, background-color, stroke, and fill in minified and unminified versions.

## Usage

If you're developing using LESS, feel free to `@import` vars.less so that you have access to the variables. If you just want to use the classes, include main.css or main.min.css in your HTML.

### Colors

To set the color, use the class name without any prefixes. The following code will set the text within a div to use the 500 variant of red.

```
<div class="red-500"></div>
```

### Background Colors

To set background-color, use ".bg-" plus the class name. The following code will set the background-color within a div to use the 500 variant of red.

```
<div class="bg-red-500"></div>
```

### Stroke

To set stroke, use ".stroke-" plus the class name. The following code will set the stoke on an SVG to use the 500 variant of red.

```
<svg class="stroke-red-500"></svg>
```

### Fill

To set fill, use ".fill-" plus the class name. The following code will set the stoke on an SVG to use the 500 variant of red.

```
<svg class="fill-red-500"></svg>
```
